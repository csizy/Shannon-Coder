Coder segment of the Shannon coder-decoder.

#### Future Development Fields in Question

1: Evaluate number of independent hashIDs and number of independent symbols per symbol list/hash element.\
Use static arrays instead of dynamic arrays. Improve search algorythms due to static array by indexing.\
Is contiguous memory allocation (static array!) possible with 'such' extension?

2: Optimize search algorithms by using relative indexing.\
( Eg.: moveHashCursor(lastCursorPos, relativeIndex{...}) )

3: New data storage structure and algorithms based on alphabetical order, hash ID, symbol probability weigh.
	
  Tip#1:
  
            	1st lvl -> Alphabetic groups according to 1st letter(and number)
		2nd lvl -> Hash tables according to hash IDs
		3rd lvl -> Symbols in alphabetic order in lists

4: Capability of processing numbers.

5: Randomize pivot and modify algorythm (if necessary) in function 'partition'.

Note that each development field have to be launched and treated in a separate branch from the master branch.
